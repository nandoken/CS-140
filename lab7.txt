1)  Log into the school linux server. Pick a text file from your home directory for this exercise. Show the command to convert it to DOS format with a ".txt" extension. For example, the file fruit would be converted to the file fruit.txt.

-fernando.ames@syccuxas01:~> mv fruit fruit.txt
fernando.ames@syccuxas01:~> ls

2) On your local machine began a secure file transfer program such as PSFTP on Windows or another command-line-interface version of sftp on Linux & Mac OS. Show the command to connect to syccuxas01.pcc.edu from your local machine.

fernando.ames@syccuxas01:~> sftp fernando.ames@syccuxas01.pcc.edu

3) Show the sftp command to print your local directory. Next show the command to change your local directory to another directory, such as the full path to your browser's directory for Downloads. Verify that the directory changed worked by again printing your local directory.

sftp> lpwd
Local working directory: /Users/fernando.ames
sftp> lcd Downloads
Local working directory: /Users/fernando.ames/Downloads
sftp> lpwd
Local working directory: /Users/fernando.ames




4) Show the sftp command to transfer the DOS format text file, such as fruit.txt, to your local machine. Open it up in a text editor but your local machine to verify that the transfer worked as expected.

sftp> get /home/student/fernando.ames/fruit.txt
Fetching /home/student/fernando.ames/fruit.txt to fruit.txt    
sftp> lls

sftp> exit
fernando.ames@syccuxas01:~> vi fruit.txt


5) Why is it generally recommended to use secure file transfer utilities rather than ftp?

-.sftp is secured file transfer protocol, unlike ftp, sftp uses secured mode to transfer the files. Moreover, sftp used one way connection and encrypts the data which is getting transferred in a secured way.
